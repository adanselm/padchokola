{"name":"Padchokola","tagline":"MIDI controller with the sense of rhythm","body":"Padchokola is an Arduino based Midi controller which comes with some added synchronization capabilities, since it can be set as Midi Clock master or MTC (Midi Time Code) master.\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n## Where does the name \"Padchokola\" come from?\r\nIt is a very famous (and bad) joke made even more famous with the movie [The Intouchables](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/) where the disabled guy asks his assistant for candies, and the assistant answers \"No you can't. No arms, no chocolate!\". No chocolate being \"Pas de chocolat\" in French, it became funny to use it to describe a pedal you only need your feet to operate... I told you it was bad!\r\n## Who are you?\r\nI'm Adrien (@adanselm). I co-founded a company called [Springbeats](http://springbeats.com) which works on music production software. I happened to need a foot controller to record myself playing the guitar. I also added some midi synchronization capabilities to better test our software. I figured it could be useful to others. I sometimes share my thoughts on entrepreneurship, music and software on [twitter](https://twitter.com/adanselm) or [google plus](https://plus.google.com/u/0/103990689367636425141/posts).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
