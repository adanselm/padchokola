{"name":"Padchokola","tagline":"MIDI controller with the sense of rhythm","body":"# Presentation\r\nPadchokola is an Arduino based Midi controller which comes with some added synchronization capabilities, since it can be set as Midi Clock master or MTC (Midi Time Code) master.\r\n\r\n![Overview of the pedal exterior](https://raw.github.com/adanselm/padchokola/gh-pages/images/pedal_view.JPG)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* 3 footswitches, sending different events on short and long hold\r\n* Midi Clock master to control the tempo of your sequencer, looper, drum machine, etc.\r\n* Midi Timecode master to synchronize and control playback on different sources.\r\n* Rotary encoder for tempo setting or to be used as a midi controller as well\r\n* 3 positions switch to choose between normal controller mode, midi clock master or MTC master mode.\r\n* 4 digit display\r\n* Arduino-based design (fully compatible with Arduino IDE given that you have an external programmer)\r\n\r\n## Licensing\r\n* Since the **board design** is based on [Adafruit's Boarduino](http://www.ladyada.net/make/boarduino/), it stays with the **Creative Commons 2.5 - Attribution - Share Alike license**. So does the 7-segment display extension.\r\n* I wrote all the **code** from scratch and decided to put it under **GPLv2**. I started with the Timer1 library to handle interruptions for the midi clock, but it happened to behave strangely at high bpm so I decided to come back to something simpler.\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n## Where does the name \"Padchokola\" come from?\r\nIt is a very famous (and bad) joke made even more famous with the movie [The Intouchables](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/) where the disabled guy asks his assistant for candies, and the assistant answers \"No you can't. No arms, no chocolate!\". No chocolate being \"Pas de chocolat\" in French, it became funny to use it to describe a pedal you only need your feet to operate... I told you it was bad!\r\n\r\n## Who are you?\r\nI'm Adrien (@adanselm). I co-founded a company called [Springbeats](http://springbeats.com) which works on music production software. I happened to need a foot controller to record myself playing the guitar. I also added some midi synchronization capabilities to better test our software. I figured it could be useful to others. I sometimes share my thoughts on entrepreneurship, music and software on [twitter](https://twitter.com/adanselm) or [google plus](https://plus.google.com/u/0/103990689367636425141/posts).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
